## Goodreads-Book-Recommendation

After an indepth exploratory analysis, we built the following models in Python:

1. KNN Based Recommendations with Euclidean distance and cosine metrics
2. User based Collaborative Filtering to recommend books based on past userÂ history
3. Item based Collaborative Filtering using Cosine Similarity, Correlation and Matrix Decomposition
